Hello! This program was created with the purpose of learning how to use the python programming language, and sharpen my skills in using classes, methods, inheritance!

It is called 'Calorie Calculator' and is a simple program which allows the user to input all of the food items they have eaten for the day, and return to them a calorie total.
